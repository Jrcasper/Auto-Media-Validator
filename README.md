# Auto-Media-Validator
Auto Media Validator is a high-performance, automated tool designed to verify the binary integrity of large media libraries. It solves the problem of "bit rot" and silent file corruption by performing deep recursive scans of local and network directories (NAS/SMB), identifying files that are physically present but internally damaged.
